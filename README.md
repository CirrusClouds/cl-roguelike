# cl-roguelike

This package is heavily based off of the cl-rltut tutorial for common lisp but I quickly diverged from that path because I felt like going down a more functional path with some of the code and had a different priority for feature implementation. 

Warning: This lib makes use of my cl-utter lib

To do: 
-Build a proper pathfinding algo (djikstra's is too slow and practically is unuseable)
-Flesh out the relations system and interactions 
-FOV
